Here are a few tips for keeping cool during the heatwave.

### ¹ Drink plenty of water - avoid caffeine and make sure you're drinking lots of water. If you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated.

### ² Use Fans, obviously. Ideally at LEAST 1 (one) desk fan, and 1 (one) tower fan.

### ³ Open your doors.

### ⁴ Open your windows.

### ⁵ Close your curtains and/or blinds to keep the warming sun-rays out.

### ⁶ Tie up your hair if it’s long, with a bobble, so it's not warming up your neck and upper back like a hair-scarf.

### ⁷ Eat ice-cream.

### ⁸ Dress for the weather in thinner, lighter clothing. Clothing that is light-coloured reflects heat-energy more than clothes that are dark/black.

Thanks for reading! Hope it helps,<br>
