## Migrating to Windows (unfortunately not an early April Fools' Joke..)

Due to hardware compatibility concerns that I cannot overcome, regardless of driver, setting, or distro, I am forced, against my will, to migrate entirely over to Windows 10, after being unable to come up with a solution or alternative.
It is a sad day, I used Linux non-stop as my primary and only OS for 7 and a half years. But I'm not wasting a grand's worth of investment on this hardware by not taking advantage of it, now.

Tip: If you truly do need to run Linux, go with NVIDIA for your graphics card vendor. That is all.
