<span style="color:white;"><article><span style="letter-spacing:-0px; padding:10px; font-size:15px; background-color:black; display:inline-block; font-weight:600;">Surprised this still needs to be said, you'd think after so long people would get it into their thick skulls that this stuff is a good idea to not cause more harm.
<br><br>
Wear a mask.
<br><br>
Try to stay at home if you can, or, rather, don't needlessly be 
outside exposing yourself to others for little reason.
<br><br>
Social distance 2 metres (7 feet).
<br><br>
Practice good hand hygiene, such as washing with soap & hot 
water, & using hand sanitizer gels when they are available.
