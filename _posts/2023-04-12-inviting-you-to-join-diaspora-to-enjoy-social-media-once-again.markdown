Hello everybody!

A while ago I moved to diaspora, fully and permanently, and those who wished to continue using social media with me made accounts on a diaspora pod, also.

This post is to invite anyone who may have missed the initial announcement, or those who I've met since, who may wish to use traditional social media with me.
<br>
## What *is* diaspora?
diaspora is a decentralized social network where you are in control, created in 2010, and still going strong to this day, with a delightful, creative, smart, and welcoming community.

Along with the features you'd expect of a social media site, it also supports following hashtags, like how you'd follow a user, Markdown text formatting in posts, and Aspects (groups of creatures) which are like Google+'s "circles" feature. [rip Google+]

Still not convinced? You can learn more about diaspora on [https://diasporafoundation.org/](https://diasporafoundation.org/) and also in a more technical regard on [https://fediverse.party/en/diaspora/](https://fediverse.party/en/diaspora/) &thinsp;&thinsp;..&nbsp;!

## So, what's next?

Well, my social media is diaspora (and specifically as **@novimatrem@iviv.hu** [https://iviv.hu/people/ad5501b0ab2f013ac994723c915ba918](https://iviv.hu/people/ad5501b0ab2f013ac994723c915ba918)) - and it has been for quite a while.
