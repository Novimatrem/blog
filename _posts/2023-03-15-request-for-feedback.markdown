## Request for feedback

I have a question I'd like to ask you to answer that'd help me quite a bit to get answers to, and because I'm forgetful, I put it in the form of a Google Form, basically it's: 

'What can I [zoey] (Novimatrem) do to be and look more feminine/girly?' 

sorry for doing it this way but I am silly and lose track of things, but, it'd be really helpful to get an answer or a few.
