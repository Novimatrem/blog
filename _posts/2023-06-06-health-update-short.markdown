My physical health has been slowly declining over time ever since I became 18.
My mental health took a big downfall in late 2019, but I managed to recover it, eventually, until the period of 5 months ago to right now, it's now not great anymore, again, now.
I'm at a point where unless I take notable concern, give fucks, and take some notable action to do anything about my mental and physical healths, things are going to begin to get irrevocably not-great in the coming time.

I'm not sure if I have that in me.

I'm not posting this as a pity party, I'm just not especially sure how to continue, and how to have the drive to.

Regardless, thanks for reading,<br>
