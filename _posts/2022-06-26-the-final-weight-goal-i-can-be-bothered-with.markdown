This is a quick blog post today, as a short update.

Before you worry, I'm completely fine and healthy.

I've got an updated weight goal today, on reflections from an ultrasound at the hospital, and some advice from a doctor.

Dieting is very difficult, and exercise is even harder, for me, so I probably won't be losing too much more than I mention here, but I'm very good at keeping my weight stable at a defined point, generally.

I've been advised to, and I will be trying my best, to make my way to 230lbs, and then I'll probably be staying there, out of not being able to put in further effort due to disliking small portions and bland food.

But anyway, I've been told that's how much I need to lose, to stay on the healthy side of being large, without it being a danger, as told with compelling evidence from a trusted source, and as such, that's what I'll be doing.

See you later.
