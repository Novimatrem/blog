### The best character reference I can manage, right now:

Novimatrem-chan is an anime-style catgirl. Her hair is straight and fluffy with a mousy brown color. Her cat ears are the same color as her hair and they have round hair tufts inside them. Her eyes are pale blue. Her skin is a light asian skin tone. She is looking at the viewer with a faint, friendly smile and slightly raised eyebrows.

She's quite a big girl, wearing a pretty traditional stereotypical anime schoolgirl outfit, visible from behind her is her cat tail, which is the same colour as her head hair and ears. She wears opaque thigh-highs.

Here is a link to all the assets that I currently have for her, yes, it's not much: [https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/novimatrem.gitlab.io/-/tree/master/novi_transparent_assets](https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/novimatrem.gitlab.io/-/tree/master/novi_transparent_assets)

The Novimatrem original profile picture was machine-generated by "This Waifu Does Not Exist", and cleaned up by myself- she's not from any actual anime, and is unique.

These are images to perhaps inspire from:

and as for an actual standing pose, this would be ideal- just a normal standing pose, as pictured below:
