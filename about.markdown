#### Novimatrem üêàüê± - Hobbyist Linux systems administrator, open-source software & web-developer, and free-software advocate.

Hi, I'm Novi- or *Novimatrem*.

I'm a sleepy young woman who's a web developer and Linux tinkerer, living in the United Kingdom. A pansexual, polyamorous, cat-kin (otherkin) girl. A big fan of technology, programming, food, computer hardware & software, and I spend a lot of my time writing code. gaming is pretty good, too

My pronouns are she/her/hers, and I'm a pacifist, and notably tired all the time. Recently I've been trying to get into writing more, which is why I made this blog, and my site. Trying my best to make cool stuff for everyone, because seeing people get joy from things I do makes me happy.

I'm an open-source advocate, and recommend and prioritise the use of free libre software, and open non-proprietary services-- but that doesn't mean I'm a die-hard only-FLOSS extremist.

Sorry if my writing or sentence structure seems awkward or confusing sometimes, or something doesn't make sense, I have autism, and likely other neurodivergences- it shouldn‚Äôt affect anything much, but please ask for clarity if I ever post something you‚Äôre unsure of.

I can also be quite shy, sometimes, and I apologise for that.

I signed up for and filled in a pronouns.page for myself, please see it to learn my pronouns, name, species, things I am, and am proud of. Also included are a small selection of words I feel comfortable being used for me, so you can get the general theme of how to refer to me. Please take a look: [https://en.pronouns.page/@Novimatrem](https://en.pronouns.page/@Novimatrem)

and I know it sounds absurd, but if you use my real name can you type it in lowercase please, that's more comforting for me, and less distressing. Sorry if that's odd sounding.

Visit my website for much more of me and the things I do:

Feel free to e-mail me with thoughts, feedback, etc. - [TheNovimatrem@protonmail.ch](mailto:TheNovimatrem@protonmail.ch)

and yes, I really am a cat-girl. üíö

Her cat ears are the same color as her hair and they have round hair tufts inside them. Her eyes are pale blue. Her skin is a light asian skin tone. She is looking at the viewer with a faint, friendly smile and slightly raised eyebrows.*
