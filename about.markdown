## About me

#### Novimatrem üêàüê± - Hobbyist Linux systems administrator, open-source software & web-developer, and free-software advocate.

Hi, I'm Novi- or *Novimatrem*.

I'm a young woman who's a web developer and Linux tinkerer, living in the United Kingdom. A pansexual, polyamorous, cat-kin (otherkin) plump girl. A fan of technology, programming, food, computer hardware & software, and I spend a lot of my time writing code. gaming is pretty good, too

 My pronouns are she/her/hers, and I'm a pacifist, and notably tired all the time. Recently I've been trying to get into writing more, which is why I made this blog, and my site. Trying my best to make cool stuff for everyone, because seeing people get joy from things I do makes me happy.

I'm an open-source advocate, and recommend and prioritise the use of free libre software, and open non-proprietary services-- but that doesn't mean I'm a die-hard only-FLOSS extremist.

Sorry if my writing or sentence structure seems awkward or confusing sometimes, or something doesn't make sense, I have autism, and likely other neurodivergences- it shouldn‚Äôt affect anything much, but please ask for clarity if I ever post something you‚Äôre unsure of.

Visit my website for much more of me and the things I do:

Feel free to e-mail me with thoughts, feedback, etc. - [TheNovimatrem@protonmail.ch](mailto:TheNovimatrem@protonmail.ch)

and yes, I really am a cat-girl.
